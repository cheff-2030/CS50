# CS50
CS50 Coursework

Contains homework and lab assignments for the CS50 course. 

Includes the following files, in order of complexity and with key concept indicated:

  1. hello.c
     - Requests a name from the user and prints text greeting the user.
     - printf
  2. mario.c
     - Requests a "height" from the user then outputs a hash "hill" of the designated height, similar to those seen in the Mario game franchise.
     - Loops, printf
  3. population.c
     - Requests a "starting size" and "Ending Size" for a population until parameters are met, then outputs the number of years it will take to reach that size 
       using a provided formula.
     - Loops
  4. cash.c
     - Requests a dollar amount from the user then outputs the minimum number of USD coins needed to pay out that amount in change
     - Loops
  5. scrabble.c
     - Requests a word from Player 1 and Player 2, then outputs the winner based on whose word is worth more Scrabble points.
     - Arrays
  6. readability.c
     - Requests a string from the user then outputs a grade reading level based on lenth of words and sentences.
     - Functions
  7. caesar.c
     - Takes a numberical key as an input, then requests a plaintext phrase from the user and outputs ciphertext using the input key to shift letters. Includes 
       error messages and codes if the user's input does not match the expected format and guidelines.
     - Functions
  8. substitution.c
     - Takes a 26 alphabetical character key as an input, then requests a plaintext phrase from the user and outputs ciphertext using the input key to change    
       letters. Includes error messages and codes if the user's input does not match the expected format and guidelines.
     - Functions, Arrays
  9. plurality.c
     - Takes up to 9 "candidate names" as arguments, then asks the user for the number of "voters" and asks each voter to vote for a candidate, before finally
       printing the name of the candidate with the most votes. Includes error messages if a voter enters a name that does not match a candidate.
     - Structures, Functions, Arrays
 10. runoff.c
     - Takes up to 9 "candidate names" as arguments, then asks the user for the number of "voters" and asks each voter to rank their candidates. The program then
       conducts a runoff election, iterating and eliminating the candidate with the least votes until there is a winner or tie.
     - Structures, Functions, Arrays
